# Zelda: A New Light - Source Code
Most of the early work on *The Legend of Zelda: A New Light* was done directly in 6502 bytecode. Source code and a build script were added later in development as enhancements started getting more complicated. As such, the code available here is only partial and also relies on [Zelda Expansion](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5950/).

A description of the resulting changes is available in [readme.txt](README.txt). The final patch is available in [releases](https://github.com/gzip/nes-6502-zelda-a-new-light/releases).
